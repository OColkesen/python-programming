# python-programming
Programming exercises using different features of Python.

The files include Python programs from a variety of levels. This repository includes most of the code I have written when I started learning Python as a part of the Programming and Problem Solving class I took at Davidson College. The code for the connect4 game includes the most complex code, which also uses object-oriented programming.
